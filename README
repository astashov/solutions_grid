== Description

This is Ruby On Rails plugin, implementing grid with sorting, filtering and 
paginating (by will_paginate plugin).

This verstion for certain application only! As usual plugin it probably will be useless.


== Features

 * Sorting and Filtering without AJAX.
 * User-defined grid templates
 * User-defined actions and record's values.


== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/astashov/solutions_grid.git vendor/plugins/solutions_grid

or as submodule

  git submodule add git://github.com/astashov/solutions_grid.git vendor/plugins/solutions_grid


== Using

For using of this plugin, you should do 3 steps:

  1. Create grid object in your controller.
     
    @grid = get_grid(:name => "users", :model => User, :columns => { :show => %w{login email} })

  2. Show this grid object in your view

    %table
      %tr
        - @grid.options[:columns][:show].each do |column|
          %th= show_grid_header(items.options, column)
      - @grid.records.each do |record|
        %tr
          - @grid.options[:columns][:show].each do |column|
            %td= show_grid_value(items.options, column, record)

  4. Add plugin's routes to your routes.rb
    
    map.grid_routes

Also, there are optional additional features:

  5. Create your own rules to display fields and actions of the grid by creating
     files in app/helpers/attributes (see below)

  6. You can tweak the grid object by many additional parameters (look at documentation
     to Grid.new and get_grid).


== User-defined display of actions and values
 
 You can create your own rules to display columns (e.g., you need to show 'Yes' if some boolean
 column is true, and 'No' if it is false). For that, you should add different method to 
 app/helpers/attributes/some_module.rb. Examples (we have grid with name 'feeds'):
 
   module SolutionsGrid::Attributes

     # Header for column name of grid 'feeds'
     def feeds_header_name; end
     
     # Header for column name of any grid
     def header_name; end

     # Value for column name of grid 'feeds'
     def feeds_name(record); end

     # Value for column name of any grid
     def grid_name(record); end
     
   end
 
 If such method will not be founded, then it just show header by humanizing column, and show values 
 as it stored in the database.
